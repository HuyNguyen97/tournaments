Simulation code is contained in `tournament.py`. Docstrings there should be pretty explanatory. The various iPython notebooks contain sufficient sample code to understand and run simulations.

The main analysis document is `tourney.ipynb`. There is also R code to scrape debate Google Docs in `debate_data.Rmd`, and the scraped output is pushed to the `data` folder.

Writeup is in `writeup.md` and wrapped lightly in an Rmd template (somewhere on my laptop) to create pdf output
